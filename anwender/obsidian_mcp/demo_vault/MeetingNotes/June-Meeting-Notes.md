**June Meeting Notes**
*Topics*:
1. 🐻 Honey surplus redistribution to bear colonies (30% of June harvest)
2. 🌸 Testing lavender-infused honey for bear-friendly flavor profiles
3. 📊 Q2 bear engagement metrics review

*Meeting Protocol*:
All bears were present (except Grizzly #7 who was napping in the sun). Honey distribution followed the "Share and Sip" rule—no one left with more than 200g per session. The lavender honey trial showed 40% acceptance by bears, though one bear (Squish) preferred wildflower honey.

*Todos*:
- [ ] Finalize lavender honey batch by June 28
- [ ] Track bear preferences via scent-marking (use honey-stained leaves)
- [ ] Draft bear-friendly honey labeling guidelines

*Next Meeting*: July 15 – Focus on bear migration patterns and honey storage solutions.
